Welcome to Puzzle Bubble.

This is a maths puzzle game aimed to teach users the basics of mathematics through speed and accuracy of
* Addition
* Subtraction
* Multiplication
* Division

It operates from data stored with the Parse Service.  All puzzles are stored as objects on the Parse server
and are retrieved, parsed and interpreted by the application.  In this manner the application can have its problems easily updated
without updating the code itself.

The application supports mutliple users and tracks each users progress through the puzzles assigning a score for solving puzzles
as well as tracking how many of the puzzles have been completed.  This information is stored in core data.


CURRENT LIMITATIONS
The Parse API is the free version and as such is limited by the number of classes that can be stored.  As such
not all puzzles have been populated.  Each will appear in the selection lists, however if the class limit is reached
when the puzzle loads an alert view will pop up and indicate as such.  The view will be dismissed so the user can select
an implemented puzzle.  Ideally going forward, a larger Parse plan would be required to further this application.

The current limit is at the Subtraction level 8, puzzle 2.  This means that all of the addition puzzles are present for testing.
Additionally, I have added the first level of each the Multiplication and Subtraction for demonstration purposes.
