Puzzle Bubble
========================

This is an iPhone App for teaching arithmetic in a fun, puzzle oriented way.
Problem sets include,
- addition
- subtraction
- multiplication
- division

Problems are presented to the user in the form on an equation (e.g. 1 + ?)
and a list of 9 variables are provided for the user to substitute into the equation and solve.
The answers are randomly arranged in a 3x3 grid for the user to select the correct sequence of answers.

Solving a problem set gains the user points, and the faster they solve the problem the more points they score!
